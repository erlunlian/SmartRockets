# smartRockets
This is a 2D pathfinding evolutionary simulator with reinforcement learning, which finds the most efficient path to a given coordinate.
The creatures (rockets) are created in the beginning, and they travel in random directions. I implemented a genetic algorithm which allows the rockets to learn based on 3 different data points: distance from coordinate, distance traveled, and time spent. By adjusting the weights of these 3 data points, the rockets were able to learn to find the optimal path to a coordinate.
It's fun to see the evolution visually generation by generation.
